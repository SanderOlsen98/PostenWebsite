# Posten Terminal Dashboard

This is a project I created for Posten with the aim of making the morning meetings shorter and faster, as well as haveing a better overview of
who needs help during that day and what parcels they have left behind. This website will also be easier for the drivers to keep up to date if there
are any news.

I also had some problems with CORS which led me to having problems deploying the website. I do have a Wordpress REST API that is public hosted with the following username and password:

Username: sanderolsen

Password: Dfqcc9Uq7NeBJhYpgFQ6kM0y

As of now my api redirects to localhost,
I have included the wordpress XML file for you to import that locally to your computer in order to test with the posts etc i have created. 
In the meanwhile i still need to figure how to fix the CORS problem.

But if you want to try with the public hosted API the link is below. The username and password is still the same.

## Getting Started with This Project

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
